                <p>
                  This collection was personally compiled by Professor Yang Xiaokai during his lifetime, with the "constitutional" theme also determined by Yang himself. It includes all his important articles on this subject, reflecting Yang's profound thinking on the relationship between "constitution" and economic development. The book was originally intended to be published by a "famous university" press in China, but for well-known reasons, this wish was not fulfilled during his lifetime. This publication has now been authorized by Yang Xiaokai's family.

                <p>
                  Recent changes in China's social situation have proven many of the author's prescient judgments: without constitutional support, genuine economic reform is impossible; without ideological reform, there can be no real political reform; without social equity, there can be no genuine market economy; economic development dominated by "government opportunism" brings only greater income inequality; without land system reform—land privatization—it is impossible to liberate China's hundreds of millions of farmers and develop rural areas; industrialization based solely on technological imitation without institutional liberalization can only lead to "late-mover disadvantage"; industrialization under political monopoly is a breeding ground for "bad capitalism"... A society that denies constitutionalism will not have genuine economic development.

                        <strong>Yang Xiaokai</strong> (1948-2004), formerly known as Yang Xiguang, was a Princeton University PhD and renowned economist. He served as Chair Professor at Monash University, Australia, Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, and Director of the Center for the Study of Increasing Returns and Economic Organization.

                    His proposed and researched New Classical Economics and Inframarginal Analysis were called "the most important economic research achievements today" by Nobel Prize winner James Buchanan. Due to his tremendous achievements in economics, he was hailed as "the Chinese scholar closest to the Nobel Prize in Economics."

                  <p>
                    During the Cultural Revolution, Yang Xiaokai was a student at Changsha No. 1 Middle School in Hunan. He was imprisoned for ten years due to his big-character poster "Whither China?" While studying in the United States, he wrote about his prison experience in "Record of Monsters and Demons," published numerous papers in prestigious international economics journals, and authored the 9-volume "Yang Xiaokai Academic Library" and many economic essays. He passed away in Melbourne on July 7, 2004.

                  "I witnessed Yang Xiaokai's transformation from a mathematical economist to a constitutional thinker. In my view, Xiaokai's thoughts on constitutionalism represent the pinnacle of his lifelong academic thinking, closely related to his lifelong 'China complex.' He wanted to find a viable path to modernization for the motherland that nurtured him. Unfortunately, due to his early death and changes in China's public opinion environment, most of his papers on constitutionalism could not be published openly. But great thoughts never lose their luster with the passage of time. Today's world has become more uncertain, and today's China still doesn't know where it's heading. The publication of Yang Xiaokai's 'Constitution and Economics' collection comes at the right time. His academic thought remains fresh and vibrant!"
